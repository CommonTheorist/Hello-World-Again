<h1>Hello HTML</h1>
<p>Stoked on what I've been learning through 'A smarter wy to learn.'<br>
It's a dorky name, but I've been enjoying it.</p>
<h3>Can't wait for CSS</h3>
<p>CSS is next. Then java script. Then I'll make the jump to Python</p>
<h5>Python as a career choice</h5>
<p>So, it seems like python could be the better career option over javascript.<br>
Although, there are many career options in tech and it doesn't have to be directly related to programming per se.</p>
<h6> Html is a rad way to start</h6>
